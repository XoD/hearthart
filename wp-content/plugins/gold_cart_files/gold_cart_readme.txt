Copy the gold_cart_files directory into the wp-content/uploads/wpsc/upgrades folder. 

This folder should be automatically created when the e-commerce plugin is activated, but if it is not, you will have to create it yourself.

Now a new panel should appear in the Upgrades page where you must enter your API Username and API Key.
